# Masterming Mastermind

In this repository I'll give my take on Mastermind. The code consists of multiple functions that are savely stored in functions.py. Every algorithm has it's own file with their 'nextGuess' implementation. 

To test every algorithm, you simply run the main.py file and select which game mode you would like to play. If you are done, simply press 5 when you get prompted to enter the game mode and the game will end. Enjoy. 

While playing, make shure to only use the colours: Red (R), Green (G), Blue (B), Yellow (Y), Orange (O) or Purple (P).
